// Dev notes

This library is pretty alpha.  It works, but there's some stuff that needs to be refactored.
 
 * Packet callbacks should pass an object of a packet type instead of the parsed header and raw ax.25 info field
    * Right now each callback has to decode the ax.25 data field to extract lat/long/reports, messages, etc.
    * The message call back has to handle ack/nack itself.  This makes logical sense since a bot might want to respond to messages not destined for it, but there should be a helper function that does the parsing and ack for you
 
 * Doesn't support mic-e
 * Doesn't support wx objects
 
 other stuff
